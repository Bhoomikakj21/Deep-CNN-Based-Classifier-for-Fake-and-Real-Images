readme_content = """Deep-CNN-Based Classifier for Fake and Real Images

Project Summary:
This project implements a deep learning–based image classifier to detect whether an image is real or fake.
It uses three CNN models — Xception, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet50 — each fine-tuned on a labeled dataset.
An ensemble model combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reliability.

How to Run:
1. Open a terminal and go to the 'Code/' directory:
   cd Code/

2. Make the run script executable (only once):
   chmod +x run.sh

3. Execute the project:
   ./run.sh

This script will:
- Install dependencies
- Run the training and evaluation notebook
- Validate model files

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Packages listed in requirements.txt
